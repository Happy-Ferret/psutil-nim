## Background

I love Python and [psutil](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil) and all the
power they provide but bundling a Python app is a pain. Having a psutil library
in Nim seemed like the logical next step.

## Install

There's really no good way to install right now. Clone/download the repo and
include it in your project tree. Once I have a somewhat complete Linux version
I'll put it up on Nimble.

## Usage

Just some basic usage below until I get the example apps working and can mirror
what's in psutil's documentation.

```
import psutil

echo net_if_addrs()
echo boot_time()
echo users()
```
